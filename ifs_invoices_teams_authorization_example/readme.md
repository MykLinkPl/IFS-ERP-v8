# Invoice Approval â€“ IFS â†’ Webhook â†’ Teams (Overview)

A lightweight approval flow for supplier invoices.

**Flow**
1. An invoice is entered in **IFS** (with an authorizer).
2. IFS (or an integration job) sends the invoice header to a public **webhook API**.
3. The webhook returns **approval** and **status** URLs.
4. The approver receives a **Teams** message with the approval link.
5. The approval page shows supplier, amount, and current status.
6. After clicking **Approve**, a confirmation modal appears.
7. IFS consumes the event/status and authorizes the invoice.
